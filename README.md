# Logistic-Regression
### Logistic Regression Classification Application with Over-Sampling Implementation for Imbalanced Data in Python Using scikit-learn

This repository contains the analysis of baseball statistics using MLB Statcast Metrics.

**Goals**

- Using MLB Statcast Metrics, summarize and examine baseball statistics.
- Build and train a Logistic Regression Classification model to predict home runs.
- Implement over-sampling for imbalanced data to improve the quality of predictive modeling (i.e., generalizability).
- Apply regularization and cross-validation techniques for model evaluation, selection, and optimization.
