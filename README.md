**Goals**

- Using MLB Statcast Metrics, summarize and examine baseball statistics.

- Build and train a Logistic Regression Classification model to predict home runs.
- Implement over-sampling for imbalanced data to improve the quality of predictive modeling (i.e., generalizability).
- Apply regularization and cross-validation techniques for model evaluation, selection, and optimization.

- Build and train Decision-Classification Tree models to predict home runs and extra-base hits.
